## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- jQuery


### What I learned

I learnt more about the "on click" event in jQuery and attr() method too. 
Also I learnt how to make custom checkboxes and use the copy functionality in JavaScript.

### Continued development

I had trouble with the progress background on active states.
I want to focus more on this and achieve this feature

### Useful resources

- [Range Slider Codepen](https://codepen.io/shashank_coder/pen/jOqxOpK) - This helped me to get the idea for the character length slider with numbering feature.
- [Password Generator](https://codepen.io/ShortCode/pen/jOzmwRm) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand the concept of COPY.
